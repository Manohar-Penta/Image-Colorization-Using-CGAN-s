# Image-Colorization-Using-CGAN-s

* This project is done under the guidance of Vision And Language Group @IIT Roorkee by myself(Manohar-Penta enroll.no. 20115085 email: penta_m@ee.iitr.ac.in) and RS Suriya(enroll.no. 20115099 email: r_ss@ee.iitr.ac.in).

## Problem Statement
The task of colourizing black and white photographs necessitates a lot of human input and hardcoding. The goal is to create an end-to-end deep learning pipeline that can automate the task of image colorization by taking a black and white image as input and producing a colourized image as output.
## Motivation
Colorization is the process of adding colour information to monochrome photographs or videos. The colorization of grayscale images is an ill-posed problem, with multiple correct solutions. Online tools can be used for image colorization but the problem with these tools is a lack of inductive bias like in the image of an apple above which results in inappropriate colours and doesnâ€™t even work for a few image domains. Deep learning algorithms that better understand image data like the colours that are generally observed for human faces should ideally perform better in this task.
## Approach
*	The colorization of grayscale images can be thought of as an image-to-image translation task where we have the corresponding labels for the input grayscale image. A conditional GAN conditioned on grayscale images can be used to generate the corresponding colorized images.
*	The architecture of the model consists of a conditional generator with grayscale image inputs and a random noise vector, and the output of the generator are two image channels a, b in the LAB image space to be concatenated with the L channel i.e., the grayscale input image.
*	This generated image is input to the PatchGAN discriminator which outputs a score for each patch in an input image based on if the patch is real or not. These are used as learning signals for the Generator to generate better images. Along with the generated images, the Discriminator is also fed real images.
*	When trained adversarially, the generator should get better at generating realistic colorized images that share a similar structure with the input grayscale images and the discriminator should get better at discriminating between real and fake images.
*	The trained generator can then be used for generating colorized images given input grayscale images.

In a GAN we have a generator and a discriminator model which learn to solve a problem together. In our setting, the generator model takes a grayscale image (1-channel image) and produces a 2-channel image, a channel for *a and another for *b. The discriminator takes these two produced channels and concatenates them with the input grayscale image and decides whether this new 3-channel image is fake or real. Of course, the discriminator also needs to see some real images (3-channel images again in Lab color space) that are not produced by the generator and should learn that they are real. 
The grayscale image which both the generator and discriminator see is the condition that we provide to both models in our GAN and expect that the they take this condition into consideration.

Let's look at the math. Consider x as the grayscale image, z as the input noise for the generator, and y as the 2-channel output we want from the generator (it can also represent the 2 color channels of a real image). Also, G is the generator model and D is the discriminator. Then the loss for our conditional GAN will be:

## Loss Function
The earlier loss function helps to produce good-looking colorful images that seem real, but to further help the models and introduce some supervision in our task, we combine this loss function with L1 Loss (you might know L1 loss as mean absolute error) of the predicted colors compared with the actual colors:

If we use L1 loss alone, the model still learns to colorize the images but it will be conservative and most of the time uses colors like "gray" or "brown" because when it doubts which color is the best, it takes the average and uses these colors to reduce the L1 loss as much as possible (it is similar to the blurring effect of L1 or L2 loss in super resolution task). Also, the L1 Loss is preferred over L2 loss (or mean squared error) because it reduces that effect of producing gray-ish images. So, our combined loss function will be:

## Implementation
### Loading Images from COCO dataset
 ``` 
 coco_path = untar_data(URLs.COCO_SAMPLE)
coco_path = str(coco_path) + "/train_sample"
paths = glob.glob(coco_path + "/*.jpg")
print(coco_path)
np.random.seed(123)
paths_subset = np.random.choice(paths, 10_000, replace=False)
rand_idxs = np.random.permutation(10_000)
train_idxs = rand_idxs[:8000]
val_idxs = rand_idxs[8000:]
train_paths = paths_subset[train_idxs]
val_paths = paths_subset[val_idxs]
print(len(train_paths), len(val_paths)) 
```
### Datasets and DataLoaders
 ```

                transforms.RandomRotation(10)
            ])
        elif split == 'val': # for test cases
            self.transforms = transforms.Resize((SIZE, SIZE),  Image.BICUBIC)
        
        self.split = split

        img = np.array(img)
        img_lab = rgb2lab(img).astype("float32")
        img_lab = transforms.ToTensor()(img_lab)
        L = img_lab[[0], ...] / 50. - 1. # feature Scaling
        ab = img_lab[[1, 2], ...] / 110. # feature Scaling
        
        return {'L': L, 'ab': ab}
